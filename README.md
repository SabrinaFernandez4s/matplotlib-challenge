# matplotlib-challenge

There were no instructions on what to name the repository, so I named it 'matplotlib-challenge'.

Inside the jupyter notebook file, you may find my code along with the different graphs we were tasked to create.

On the very top before the code starts, my analysis is shown on the markdown, which I will also provide in this Readme for your convenience:

Based on the data: there were 248 different mice subjected to different drug regimens, with 1 duplicated mouse data removed. The demographic was evenly distributed, with 51% of the mice being male and 49% being female.

In reference to Capomulin, which is our drug of interest, these 3 observations were made:

First, the data shows that as the mice were subjected with Capomulin over time, their tumor volume also decreased over time. This indicates that Capomulin is an effective drug regimen given an extended timeframe.

Second, the scatterplot indicates that the heavier a mouse is, the more tumor volume they have in their system (shown by a positive relationship). This is also supported with a correlation value of 0.84 which indicates that there is a strong connection between their weight and the tumor volume.

Lastly,  according to the data, there was only 1 potential outlier discovered for the drug Infubinol. This indicates that the data gathered and analyzed for Capomulin are accurate and may be used in a generalizing statement.

In conclusion, Capomulin is an effective treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), so long as we keep into account the other factors that could sway the results (e.g. weight and the amount of time the drug has been administered).
